# Statistical analysis
This analysis is essentially the same as the first, where I ran both Bayesian and Frequentist mixed effects logistic ordinal regression models. Again, the ordered factor `rating` (1-5) was the outcome variable, and `sentence type` was the predictor. In this case, all 4 languages had the same sentence types, in which ad adverb was pre or post verb in a either a main or relative clause. 
Just like the first dataset, random intercepts were added per participant in order to account for the nested structure of the data in both types of model. 

# Results 

The tables below detail the descriptive statistics for each sentence type and the quantity of ratings for each condition.

# Visualization of results 

Same as the first analyiss, the two plots below show the output of a Bayesian Ordinal Logistic regression (in the first plot), and probability curves per condition in the second plot. In plot 1, the points represent the probability (y-axis) and 95% confidence intervals per condition (x-axis). In the second plot, the vertical lines represent each condition, where the individual lines are probabilities of a rating per condition. The closer the vertical lines are together, the closer those conditions are rated in a particular language.

Here are the file names of the plots in this page: 

Polish plot 1 = `polish_word_order.png`

Polish plot 2 = `polish_prob_curve_word_order.png`

Norwegian plot 1 = `norwegian_word_order.png`

Norwegian plot 2 = `norwegian_prob_curve_word_order.png`

English plot 1 = `english_word_order.png`

English plot 2 = `english_prob_curve_word_order.png`
